🚀 Scalable REST API with Authentication & Role-Based Access

This project demonstrates a secure, scalable REST API with JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for a secondary entity, along with a simple React.js frontend to interact with the APIs.

🧩 Tech Stack
Backend

Node.js + Express.js

MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

JWT Authentication

bcrypt.js for password hashing

dotenv for environment configuration

cors and helmet for security

Frontend

React.js

Axios for API calls

Tailwind CSS for basic styling (if used)

React Router for navigation

⚙️ Features Implemented
🔐 Authentication

User registration and login

Passwords securely hashed using bcrypt

JWT-based authentication with token expiry

Protected routes accessible only with valid JWT

👥 Role-Based Access

Two roles: user and admin

admin can perform all CRUD operations

user has restricted access (only their own resources)

🗂️ CRUD Operations

Secondary Entity: Tasks

Features:

Create a new task

Get all tasks (admin) or user-specific tasks

Update a task

Delete a task

🧰 Validation & Error Handling

Input validation using middleware

Centralized error handler for API responses

Proper HTTP status codes for each operation

🔒 Security

Encrypted passwords

Secure token handling in headers/localStorage

Input sanitization

CORS-enabled backend

🧮 Database Schema (MongoDB – Mongoose)
User Model
{
  username: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  role: { type: String, enum: ["user", "admin"], default: "user" }
}

Task Model
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  status: { type: String, enum: ["pending","in-progress", "completed"], default: "pending" },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }
}
